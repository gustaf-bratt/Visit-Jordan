					<string>One of the great water adventures in Jordan is to hike, climb and swim through the Wadi Mujib gorge, along the east coast of the Dead Sea. Grab a lifejacket and take the plunge. The river is your only path as you trek uphill from the Dead Sea through the narrow, 50m high walls of the Wadi. Your guide will take you through a series of cascading waterfalls, each more challenging than the one before. At the end of the terrain you will find yourself at a magical pool beneath a waterfall that emerges like a mirage from amidst the surrounding warm cliffs and barren hillsides. For all adventure seekers, Wadi Mujib is not to be missed. </string>

					<key>Description</key>
					<string>A 1,300m variation in elevation and year-round water flow from seven tributaries means that Wadi Mujib enjoys a magnificent bio-diversity that is still being explored and documented today. The Mujib Reserve is the lowest nature reserve in the world, with a spectacular array of scenery near the east coast of the Dead Sea. 

The reserve is located within the deep Wadi Mujib gorge, which enters the Dead Sea at 410m below sea level. The reserve extends to the Karak and Madaba mountains to the north and south respectively, reaching 900m above sea level in some places. Over 300 species of plants, 10 species of carnivores and numerous species of permanent and migratory birds have been recorded. Some of the remote mountains and valley areas are safe havens for rare species of cats, goats and other mountain animals. Mujib&apos;s sandstone cliffs are an ideal habitat for one of the most beautiful mountain goats in the world, the horned Ibex. Mujib is also well-known for larger carnivores like the regionally scarce striped hyena and Syrian wolf, and for many kinds of birds. As well as resident birds, the reserve is strategically important as a safe stop-over for the huge number of migratory birds that annually fly along the rift valley between Africa and northeast Europe.</string>

					<key>Description</key>
					<string>The Gulf of Aqaba is famous for its marine wildlife. As the world&apos;s northernmost coral reef ecosystem it has an average water temperature of 23° Celsius. The absence of stormy weather combined with mild water currents make the Gulf of Aqaba a hospitable environment for the growth of corals and a myriad of other marine life forms. 

The Gulf of Aqaba hosts 110 species of soft corals and 120 species of hard corals. The waters and reefs that fringe the Gulf contain over 1,000 species of fish, corals, crustaceans, and mammals. Nocturnal crustaceans such as crab, shrimp, and lobster appear in search of food in the dark hours of the night. Seasonal visitors to the Gulf of Aqaba include sea turtles, dolphins, sea cows, and the harmless whale shark. 

Aqaba is the only coastal city in Jordan. This beautiful town, surrounded by fascinating colourful mountains and the blue waters of the Red Sea, expands over 27km of shoreline on the Gulf of Aqaba. The town is well-organized and is under continuous development. It has been designated as a Special Economic Zone, with special legislation to protect and improve its business, community, tourism, and environment status.</string>

					<key>Description</key>
					<string>The moonlike landscape of Wadi Rum is unique in the world. The Rum desert is dotted with massive mountains, coloured in shades of red, yellow, and orange. Their hues spill over to colour the sand dunes around the desert and the horizon of its breathtaking panorama. 

Rum&apos;s landscape hosts an ecosystem that contains many rare and endemic plants. Spring reveals hundreds of species of wild flowers, while about 120 bird species have been recorded in the area, including the Griffon Vulture, the Fan-Tailed Raven, Bonelli&apos;s Eagle, and Hume&apos;s Tawny Owl. Baseline surveys also show the existence of the Grey Wolf, Blandford&apos;s Fox, the Sand Cat, and Ibex in the area.

Wadi Rum is a place where you can become one with nature, where visitors are humbled by the towering mountains and overwhelmed by the serenity and quiet ambiance of this magnificent place. One activity that keeps attracting thrill-seekers to Wadi Rum is mountain climbing. Ascents can range from simple hikes to serious mountain climbing more than 900m up sheer granite and sandstone cliffs.</string>

					<key>Description</key>
					<string>The therapeutic benefits of the Dead Sea have been known to man for at least 2000 years. It has a unique combination of climatic conditions and elements - sun, water, mud and air - which have been proven to offer excellent natural treatments for a range of chronic ailments including dermatological problems such as Psoriasis, Atopic Dermatitis, Vitiligo, and Psoriatic Arthritis, as well as for respiratory conditions such as Asthma, and for many other ailments, including Arthritis, circulatory problems, hypertension, Parkinson&apos;s Disease and some eye problems. It can also have significant health benefits including increasing circulation, healing allergies, and revitalizing skin. 

The Dead Sea waters contain a 31.5% salt concentration and over 20 different minerals. In addition, because it is so low under sea level, the atmosphere contains layers of air that are saturated with oxygen and act as a natural UV filter; this means that one can wallow or sunbathe for longer with less risk of burning or skin cancer. The hotel and spa resorts found at the Dead Sea are world renowned and offer the very best in accommodation, facilities and spa treatments. Floating at the world&apos;s largest natural spa is truly a once in a life time experience.

Thousands of cisiting bathers come each year to enjoy the mineral-rich waters of these hyper-thermal waterfalls. These falls originate from winter rainfalls in the highland plains of Jordan and eventually feed the 109 hot and cold springs in the valley. The water is heated to temperatures of up to 63°Celcius by underground lava fissures as it makes its way through the valley before emptying into the Zarqa River.

Some of the finest art of the early Christian centuries - especially elaborate and colourful mosaics - is found in Madaba and the surrounding regions in central Jordan. 
The feature attraction here is the Madaba Mosaic Map, the oldest known geographic floor mosaic in art history that has been of use in the verification of biblical sites. The map depicts an area from Lebanon in the north to the Nile Delta in the south, from the Mediterranean Sea in the west to the Eastern Desert. It depicts numerous cities and geographical features of the region, including Jerusalem and its gates, the Dead Sea and several other biblical Christian sites.

The Serpentine Cross, which stands outside the sanctuary, is symbolic of the brass serpent carried by Moses into the desert and the cross upon which Jesus was crucified.
According to Jewish and Christian tradition, Moses was buried on this mountain by God himself, and his final resting place is unknown. Scholars continue to dispute whether the mountain currently known as Nebo is the same as the mountain referred to in the Torah. Islamic belief holds that Musa (Moses) was buried not on the mountain but a few kilometres to the west, somewhere beyond the River Jordan.</string>

The Bethany area sites formed part of the early Christian pilgrimage routes between Jerusalem, Mount Nebo and the segment of the River Jordan where Jesus is believed to have been baptized by John the Baptist. The area is also associated with the biblical account of the Prophet Elijah&apos;s ascent to heaven in a whirlwind on a chariot of fire.

Stunning archaeological discoveries since 1996 reveal pottery, coins and architectural remains from a 5th century Byzantine monastery. Also identified is the cave where John the Baptist lived, according to numerous Byzantine pilgrims&apos; texts. The cave was turned into a church and a freshwater channel running from the cave, purportedly used by John for baptizing, can still be visited today. The late Pope John Paul II visited the area in 2000, while Pope Benedict XVI visited the site in 2009.</string>

					<key>Description</key>
					<string>A sprawling city spread over 19 hills, or &apos;jebels&apos;, Amman is the modern as well as the ancient capital of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Known as Rabbath-Ammon during the Iron Age and later as Philadelphia, the ancient city that was once part of the Decapolis League, now boasts a population of around 2.5 million.

Amman, often referred to as the white city due to its low size canvas of stone houses, offers a variety of historical sites.
Towering above Amman,  the site that is known as the Citadel is now subject to numerous excavations that have revealed remains from the Neolithic period, as well as from the Hellenistic and late Roman to Arab Islamic Ages. It includes many structures such as the Temple of Hercules, the Umayyad Palace, and the Byzantine Church. At the foot of the Citadel lies the 6,000 seat Roman Theatre, which is a deep-sided bowl carved into the hill and still used for cultural events. Another newly-restored theatre is the 500-seat Odeon which is used for concerts. The three museums found in the area offer a glimpse of history and culture: the Jordan Archaeological Museum, the Folklore Museum, and the Museum of Popular Traditions.</string>

				<dict>
					<key>Description</key>
					<string>Petra, the world wonder, is without a doubt Jordan&apos;s most valuable treasure and greatest tourist attraction. It is a vast, unique city, carved into the sheer rock face by the Nabataeans - an industrious Arab people who settled there more than 2,000 years ago, turning it into an important junction for the silk, spice and other trade routes that linked China, India and southern Arabia with Egypt, Syria, Greece and Rome. 

The Treasury at Petra is a massive facade, 30m wide and 43m high, carved out of the sheer, dusky pink, rock face and dwarfing everything around it. There are hundreds of elaborate rock-cut tombs with intricate carvings - unlike the houses, which were destroyed mostly by earthquakes, the tombs were carved to last throughout the afterlife and 500 have survived, empty but bewitching as you file past their dark openings. Here also is a massive Nabataean-built, Roman-style theatre that could seat 3,000 people. There are obelisks, temples, sacrificial altars and colonnaded streets, and high above, overlooking the valley, is the impressive Ad-Deir (the Monastery) - a flight of 800 rock-cut steps takes you there. 

Petra is one of the new 7 Wonders of the World, and is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</string>

					<key>Description</key>
					<string>Jerash lies on a plain surrounded by hilly wooded areas and fertile basins. Conquered by General Pompey in 63 BC, it came under Roman rule and was one of the ten great Roman cities of the Decapolis League. The city&apos;s golden age came under Roman rule, during which time it was known as Gerasa, and the site is now generally acknowledged to be one of the best-preserved Roman provincial towns in the world. Hidden for centuries in sand before being excavated and restored over the past 70 years, Jerash reveals a fine example of the grand, formal provincial Roman urbanism that is found throughout the Middle East, comprising paved and colonnaded streets, soaring hilltop temples, handsome theatres, spacious public squares and plazas, baths, fountains and city walls pierced by towers and gates.

The main attractions in Jerash are, not surprisingly, the ruins themselves. Walk through Hadrian&apos;s Arch at the Southern gate to the city, then explore the massive arena, called the Hippodrome, take a walk through the colonnaded street, check out the Cathedral and the Nymphaeum, and enjoy the North and South theatres with their ascending rows of seats that housed city councils of old and now hosts annual concerts.

					<string>An ancient town, As-Salt was once the most important settlement in the area between the Jordan Valley and the Eastern Eesert. By the early 19th century, As-Salt was a prosperous frontier town on the edge of Ottoman Empire and the desert. Useful to all, it was ruled by none, and the people of As-Salt were said to be “free from taxation of any kind.” The town was also the centre of lucrative trading between the region and urban centres in Palestine.

Tightly built on a cluster of three hills, As-Salt has several places of interest, including splendid yellow sandstone buildings that incorporate a variety of local and European styles, Roman tombs on the outskirts of town, and the citadel. There is also a small museum and a handicrafts school where you can admire the traditional skills of ceramics, weaving, silk-screen printing and dyeing.

As-Salt&apos;s Archaeological &amp; Folklore Museum displays artefacts dating back to the Chalcolithic period to the Islamic era as well as other items relating to the history of the area. In the folklore museum there is a good presentation of Bedouin and traditional costumes and everyday folkloric items.

				<key>Karak</key>
				<dict>
					<key>Description</key>
					<string>An ancient Crusader stronghold, Karak sits at 900m above sea level and lies inside the walls of the old city. The city today is home to around 170,000 people and continues to boast a number of restored 19th century Ottoman buildings, restaurants, places to stay, and the like. But it is undoubtedly Karak Castle that dominates. 

The town is built on a triangular plateau, with the castle at its narrow southern tip. While the castle we see today essentially dates back to the 12th century, Karak has been a fortress since biblical times. Karak Castle is a dark maze of stone-vaulted halls and endless passageways. The best preserved are underground and can be reached via a massive door. More imposing than beautiful, the castle is nevertheless an impressive insight into the architectural military genius of the Crusaders.

The castle is some 220m long, 125m wide at the north end, and 40m wide at the southern end where a narrow valley deepened by a ditch separates it from the adjoining and much higher hill - once Saladin&apos;s favourite artillery position. Throughout the castle, dark and roughly-shaped Crusader masonry is easy to discern from the finely-crafted blocks of lighter and softer limestone used in later Arab work.

The two most impressive towers (&apos;burj&apos; in Arabic) of Karak are Burj Al-Banawi, a round tower bearing a monumental inscription adorned by two panthers, the emblem of Sultan Baybars; and Burj As-Sa&apos;ub, a small fortress in its own right; and Burj Az-Zahir Baybars (or Baybars Tower), a massive structure resembling the castle keep.

Karak is still a largely Christian town, and many of today&apos;s Christian families trace their origins back to the Byzantines.

				<key>Aqaba</key>
				<dict>
					<key>Description</key>
					<string>Aqaba&apos;s long history dates back to pre-biblical times, when it was known as Ayla. According to the Bible&apos;s Old Testament, King Solomon built a naval base at Ezion Geber, just 3km from where the modern town of Aqaba stands today.

From 106 AD, the Romans, who ruled the region from their base in Syria, also used Ayla as their trading sea port, until it came under the control of the Byzantine Empire in the early 4th century. The Byzantines appointed Christian Arabs from south Arabia to rule the port city on their behalf.

The Middle Ages were turbulent years for Ayla. In the 12th century, the Crusaders captured the city. They built a fort on Far&apos;un Island, known then as Ile de Graye, 7km offshore. Ayla was then retaken by Saladin and the fort became known as Saladin&apos;s Castle. In a counter-attack, the notorious crusader, Reynald de Chatillon, took the island, but lost it again to Muslim forces the following year. 

When the Mameluk Sultans of Egypt took control of the region, they renamed the city Aqaba and, in the 14th century, built the town&apos;s famous Mameluk fort, now known as the Aqaba Fort. The Mameluks were followed by the Ottomans, who ruled Aqaba for 4 centuries.

Aqaba was taken from the Ottomans in 1917 by Arab forces, together with T.E. Lawrence. At the end of World War I, the British secured Aqaba for Jordan.

				<key>Ajlun</key>
				<dict>
					<key>Description</key>
					<string>The Ajlun area has a long history of human settlement, due to its Mediterranean climate, dense forests and fertile soil. This rich history reflected in the many archaeological ruins scattered in the woodlands and surrounding villages. 

Ajlun Castle (Qal&apos;at Ar-Rabad) was built by one of Saladin&apos;s generals in 1184 AD to control the iron mines of Ajlun, and to deter the Franks from invading Ajlun. Ajlun Castle dominated the three main routes leading to the Jordan valley and protected the trade and commercial routes between Jordan and Syria; it became an important link in the defensive chain against the Crusaders, who unsuccessfully spent decades trying to capture the castle and the nearby village. Today, Ajlun Castle is a splendid sight with a fascinating warren of towers, chambers, galleries and staircases to explore, while its hilltop position offers stunning views of the Jordan Valley.

Ajlun is just a short journey from Jerash through pine forest and olive groves and boasts scores of ancient sites, including water mills, forts and villages, all in the beautiful hills and valleys of north Jordan. Nearby is the Ajlun Nature Reserve, a 13 sq km protected area of outstanding beauty and diverse wildlife. Within the reserve are two nature trails and chalet-style accommodation. The reserve is managed and maintained by the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN).

					<string>Pella is a favourite of archaeologists as it is exceptionally rich in antiquities, some of which are exceedingly old. Close by this ancient settlement, evidence has been found of some of the world&apos;s earliest camp sites and semi-permanent villages dating back 10 to 18 thousand years to the Natufian and Kebaran periods. Together with excavated ruins from the Graeco-Roman period, Pella offers visitors the opportunity to see the remains of a Chalcolithic settlement from the 4th millennium BC, evidence of Bronze and Iron Age walled cities, Byzantine churches, early Islamic residential quarters and a small medieval mosque. </string>

					<string>Built during the Crusader times, the Showbak castle appears as a natural extension of a dramatic hill; it stands as a lonely reminder of former Crusader glory. Showbak was once called &quot;Mont Real&quot; and dates from the same turbulent period as Karak. The location has provided the castle with a natural moat,through a system of valleys that surround the central hill from all directions. Showbak Castle&apos;s exterior is impressive, with a foreboding gate and an encircling triple wall. Despite the precautions of its builder, the fortress fell to Saladin only 75 years after it was raised. Inscriptions by his proud successors appear today on the castle walls.</string>

		<string>Images of the ancient Nabataean city of Petra, carved from the rock over a thousand years ago, have long been most people&apos;s first impression of Jordan.

But while Petra is indeed one of the most stunning attractions in the Middle East, Jordan offers so much more for the modern traveller.

A well-travelled bridge between sea and desert, east and west, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan is a land of mesmerizing beauty and contrasts, from the Jordan Valley, fertile, ever changing, to the remote desert canyons, immense and still. Visitors can explore splendid desert castles, gaze in awe at the haunting wilderness of Wadi Rum, or bathe in the restful waters of the Red Sea.

For adventure lovers, there&apos;s horse riding, 4x4 safaris, rock climbing and hiking. For taking it easy, nothing on earth compares to the Dead Sea and the Red Sea, with their many spa facilities.

Modern Jordan was founded by King Abdullah I after World War I. It was ruled by his grandson, the late King Hussein, for 46 years until his death in 1999, when his son, King Abdullah II, assumed the throne. Jordan has grown into a modern nation that has enjoyed a remarkable measure of peace, stability and economic growth in recent decades.</string>
